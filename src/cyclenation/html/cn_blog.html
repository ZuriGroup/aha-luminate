            <p>CycleNation joined the Amgen Tour of California on May 12th in Sacramento and May 18th in Pasadena to share heart healthy messaging with Amgen’s Breakaway From Heart Disease Campaign. The American Heart Association hosted two stationary cycling events to kick off and close the Amgen Tour of California and offered a FREE health screenings to the public that tested their cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides and blood pressure. Spectators had a unique view of the finish line and festival and were able to see the exciting finish to the races. Survivors shared their stories with thousands of attendees as a powerful reminder of the impact heart disease and stoke have on millions of Americans.</p>

Repeat.</strong> Did you know the American Heart Association | American Stroke Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of a moderate intensity physical activity like cycling? As a part of American Stroke Month, we encouraged Americans to get out and ride their bikes (or take a stationary cycling class) in honor of National Cycling Day on May 13, 2019! Thousands of Americans joined our movement by posting about their love of all things cycling on social media by using #CycleNation!</p>

            <p>Let's ride stroke and heart disease into the dust. On <strong>May 18, 2019</strong>, our band of cyclists and well-wishers met in Southampton, NY to gang up on these two leading causes of death. Each rider chose from a 27-mile, 59-mile, or 100-mile bike ride through the heart of the Hamptons. This unique and inspiring event was led by co-chairs Nick Racanelli and Louis C. Ciliberti. Riders raised more than $173,000 and were part of an exclusive team of cycling enthusiasts from the corporate, medical, and philanthropic world who are committed to our mission: To be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives – one pedal stroke at a time!</p>

            <p>In honor of World Stroke Day on October 29th, the ASA launched a new campaign “I Will Again” to promote that with good rehab and support, survivors can overcome stroke’s impact. A star already on the rise, singer-songwriter Angie Aparo earned widespread acclaim when Faith Hill and Tim McGraw each covered his songs. But in April 2016, he suffered a debilitating stroke. Doctors managed to stabilize his symptoms, but stroke caused him to forget how to speak, much less write music.</p>
            <p>Thanks to a strict recovery regimen, Aparo’s injury slowly began to heal. And nearly a year and a half later, Aparo played for a sold-out crowd and released the Album, <em>Life Is a Flower. Life Is a Gun.</em></p>
